## My process
A responsive tip calculator that helps users split a bill and calculate tip amounts per person.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) ‚Äì Utility-first CSS framework
- Flexbox & CSS Grid ‚Äì For layout structure
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) ‚Äì JavaScript library for building UI
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) ‚Äì Fast development build tool

### What I learned

- Creating **controlled components** in React
- Managing **form validation and error states** (e.g. number of people cannot be zero)
- Building a **responsive layout** with Tailwind's utility classes
- Writing **reusable functional components**

## üîÅ Continued Development

In future iterations, I plan to:

- Add keyboard accessibility and proper tab focus
- Implement animations for smoother UI feedback
- Add input formatting (e.g., currency symbol)
- Save input state in local storage for persistence
- Add unit tests for calculation logic
